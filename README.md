## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup

-   CSS custom properties

-   Flexbox

-   CSS Grid

-   Mobile-first workflow

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

-   [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - JS library

-   CSS modules for React

### What I learned

Building this project helped me learn to use and improve my knowledge of some React and JS tools, such as:

-   CSS modules.
-   React Context.
-   Axios.
-   Local Storage.
-   The clipboard object.

### Continued development

-   I tried to follow a modular approach while writing my CSS stylesheets, which helped me avoid common problems, such as selector collisions or affecting other selector's styles by mistake.

-   I used useState React hook in order to handle the possible errors that could happen while requesting information from the API.

-   To connect to the given API and fetch the information I used AXIOS, a JS library that works with promises.

-   Implemented the `@media (hover: hover) {}` CSS media query, which is used to detect if the user's device has a cursor, to add hover transitions.

-   Instead of using useState to handle my inputs state, I used useRef because it won't re-render the whole component every time that the input's value change.

-   I added some smooth animations to the elements that the user can interact with.

-   There were some components that could be re-used, so I tried to write styles that would work no matter where the component is used.

### Useful resources

-   [CSS modules](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet/) - This helped me understand the basic usage of CSS modules and how to integrate them into a React project.
-   [Why are CSS modules useful?](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/styling/css-modules/) - This article helped me understand the benefits of working with modular CSS stylesheets, such as component-scoped styles, which means no selector collisions.
-   [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs) - This is the documentation of Axios, a promise-based JS library that helped me request information from an API.
