## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup

-   CSS custom properties

-   Flexbox

-   CSS Grid

-   Mobile-first workflow

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

-   [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - JS library

-   CSS modules for React

### What I learned

Building this project helped me learn to use and improve my knowledge of some React and JS tools, such as:

-   CSS modules.
-   React Context.
-   Axios.
-   Local Storage.
-   The clipboard object.

### Continued development

I would like to keep improving my abilities in the creation of re-usable components, like buttons and links.
I would also like to learn more about React hooks, such as useRef, useState and useContext, to handle my components' state.
